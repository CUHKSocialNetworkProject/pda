<h2>What's it all about?</h2>
<p>
This is a two semesters project. Our aim is to design a “personalized” analytics system so that we can keep track and analyze our
own behavior and activities. For example, we will utilize our information like, emails, calendars, contact list, blog, SMS, ...etc so as to understand ourselves better. It will be interesting (and challenging) to do data mining so that we know, for example, “Do I
regularly exercise? If yes, is it enough? What is the percentage of people we communicate with? Is it work dominant or family
dominant? Am I happy today or feeling moody today? ....etc”. In short, we plan to design a new data mining and knowledge
discovery system that can analyze our "personal" data so that we can have a better understanding about ourselves,our activities, our
personalities,...etc. This will be a fun and creative project.</p>

<h3>Why do it?</h3>
<p>
Students will learn and apply various data mining techniques, database techniques as well as visualization techniques to realize the
system. Students need to discuss among themselves and create something useful and interesting. Students may even need to learn to do data mining on their own online social networks so as to understand themselves.</p>
<p>
There are two advantages of taking this project. First of all, students will be able to learn and apply various data mining and
machine learning algorithms in this interesting topics. Secondly, arm with the knowledge learn in this project, companies like
Baidu, Tencent or OSNs in the USA would be eager to recruit students with such deep knowledge in the subject.
